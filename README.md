# Neovim config

Originally based off of [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Setup
This config uses Lazy. Lazy is bootstrapped on first load and will install plugins automatically.

### Nerd font
For alot of symbols and glyphs to work you'll need a nerd font installed and set as your font in your terminal emulator. I use JetBrains Mono Nerd Font, you can find the nerd font variant [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
